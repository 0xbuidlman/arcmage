Arcmage
=======

Arcmage is a browser-based implementation of a CCG being developed as part 
of the [Arcmage project](http://arcmage.org). It offers the player a virtual 
table top for playing the game, without forcing any rules on the actual 
game being played.

No artificial intelligence was implemented in the platform nor are there any 
plans to implement game rules.

Furthermore, arcmage offers an online card generation tool to create new cards 
and decks.
